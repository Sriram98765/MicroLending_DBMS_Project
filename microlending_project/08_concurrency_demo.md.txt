# Transactions & Concurrency Demo

## Scenario
A "Race Condition" simulation where a system crash occurs during a payment transaction.

## Workflow
1. **Start Transaction.**
2. **Insert Repayment:** Record a payment of $500.
3. **Update Balance:** Deduct $500 from the loan balance.
4. **Simulate Error:** Execute `ROLLBACK`.

## Results

### Test 1: Rollback
**Command:** `ROLLBACK;`
**Outcome:** The Repayment record was **not** created. The Loan balance remained unchanged. This proves Atomicity (The 'A' in ACID).
